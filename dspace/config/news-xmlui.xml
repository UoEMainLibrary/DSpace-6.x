<head>Welcome to the St Andrews Research Repository</head>
<p>This is a digital repository of research output from the University of St Andrews. Since 2006 the University has required theses to be submitted to the repository. The full text of research papers can be submitted to the Repository via PURE. PURE and the repository integrate services to provide an easy submission process for the full text of research publications. The <xref target="//risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/">St Andrews Research Portal</xref> provides links to the full text of research publications which are stored in this Repository.</p>
